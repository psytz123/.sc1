## ðŸ“Š Real Data Integration Summary

### Successfully Processed:
- **248 Yarn Materials** - Complete yarn specifications with costs and suppliers
- **26 Valid Suppliers** - Filtered from 37 total (10 marked for removal)
- **121 Product Styles** - With complete BOM structures
- **330 BOM Lines** - Material requirements for all styles
- **33 Interchangeable Yarn Groups** - Identified based on identical specifications

### Data Quality Issues Identified:
1. **7 materials with $0.00 cost** - Need pricing for procurement planning
2. **2 materials with negative inventory** - Inventory reconciliation needed
3. **34 materials missing supplier IDs** - Supplier assignment required
4. **9 BOMs with incorrect percentages** - BOM validation needed

### BOM Data Issues Found and Fixed:
- **61 SKUs** were missing in integrated BOM (50% of all SKUs)
- **27 cases** where materials were incorrectly rounded to 100%
- **73 materials** were completely omitted from integrated BOM
