## How It Works: A Six-Step Process to Perfection

Our system simplifies the complexity of raw material planning into a seamless, automated, six-step process:

1.  **Forecast Unification:** We start by intelligently combining all your sales forecasts. Our system weighs each forecast based on its historical accuracy, giving you a single, reliable demand signal.
2.  **BOM Explosion:** The system automatically breaks down the demand for finished goods into the specific raw materials required, handling complex bills of materials and unit conversions effortlessly.
3.  **Inventory Netting:** We then look at what you already have. The planner subtracts available inventory and incoming stock from the gross requirements to determine exactly what you need to order.
4.  **Procurement Optimization:** This is where the magic happens. The system applies sophisticated rules, including safety stock for demand variability, minimum order quantities (MOQs), and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) principles to calculate the optimal amount to purchase.
5.  **Supplier Selection:** Our AI evaluates your suppliers based on cost, lead time, and reliability, recommending the best sourcing strategy to balance cost and risk. It even supports multi-supplier strategies to enhance supply chain resilience.
6.  **Output Generation:** Finally, the planner generates a clear, actionable report detailing what to order, from whom, and when. Each recommendation is backed by a clear rationale, giving you complete transparency.

## A Look Under the Hood: Technical Architecture

Our AI Planner is built on a robust, modern technology stack, designed for performance, scalability, and maintainability.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.12
- **Core Libraries:** Pandas (for data manipulation), NumPy (for numerical operations), Pydantic (for robust data modeling), Loguru (for logging).
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit, a fast and easy way to build beautiful data apps.
- **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose, and Systemd for flexible deployment options from local development to production servers.

### Modular by Design
The system features a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend:
-   `engine/`: Contains the core business logic for the 6-step planning process.
-   `models/`: Defines the robust Pydantic data models that power the application.
-   `utils/`: Houses shared utility functions used across the application.
-   `scripts/`: Stores scripts for data integration, database maintenance, and other operational tasks.

### Core Data Models
The planner's logic is built around a set of well-defined data models:
1.  `FinishedGoodsForecast`: Manages multi-source demand forecasts.
2.  `BillOfMaterials`: Handles complex material requirements and unit conversions.
3.  `Inventory`: Tracks stock levels, including open purchase orders.
4.  `Supplier`: Manages supplier data, including performance and cost.
5.  `ProcurementRecommendation`: Structures the final, detailed output recommendations.

## Advanced Capabilities: Your Competitive Edge

### Unparalleled Data Integration: Turn Data Chaos into a Strategic Asset
Bad data costs businesses millions in errors, missed opportunities, and wasted time. Our planner tackles this head-on. The intelligent data integration pipeline is more than just a feature; it's your foundation for reliable, data-driven decision-making.

Imagine a world where you no longer have to second-guess your inventory numbers or spend hours manually cleaning spreadsheets. Our system automatically:
-   **Eliminates Errors at the Source:** Corrects negative inventory, standardizes cost data, and validates BOM percentages, preventing costly procurement mistakes before they happen.
-   **Builds a Single Source of Truth:** Integrates disparate data sources into a clean, unified view of your supply chain.
-   **Provides Total Transparency:** Generates detailed data quality reports, so you always know not just what your data says, but how reliable it is.

This isn't just about clean data; it's about unlocking the confidence to act decisively.
