# Beverly Knits - BOM Data Quality Report

## Summary of BOM Integration Issues

This report documents the data quality issues found during BOM integration and the corrections applied.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing SKUs in Integrated BOM**
- **61 SKUs** from Style_BOM were completely missing in the integrated BOM (50% of all SKUs)
- This represented a major data loss in the integration process
- **Fix Applied**: All SKUs are now preserved in the corrected BOM

### 2. **Incorrect Rounding to 100%**
- **27 cases** where materials were incorrectly rounded up to 100%
- Examples:
  - SKU `1SM0824-60/0`: Material 18290 was changed from 9.8% to 100% (missing material 11896 with 90.2%)
  - SKU `751SM0780/1`: Material 18290 was changed from 28.3% to 100% (missing material 10027 with 71.7%)
  - SKU `2140372/I`: Material 18334 was changed from 87.8% to 100% (missing material 18928 with 12.2%)
- **Fix Applied**: Original percentages restored for all materials

### 3. **Omitted Materials**
- **73 materials** were completely omitted from the integrated BOM
- Breakdown by percentage:
  - Under 1%: 11 materials
  - 1% to 5%: 20 materials
  - 5% to 10%: 6 materials
  - **Over 10%: 36 materials (CRITICAL)**
  
- Most critical omissions (>20%):
  - `751SM0780/1`: Material 10027 (71.7%) was omitted
  - `BK 8552/0`: Material 18646 (77.8%) was omitted
  - `1SM0824-60/0`: Material 11896 (90.2%) was omitted
- **Fix Applied**: All materials are now included regardless of percentage

### 4. **Floating Point Precision Issues**
- **74 entries** had floating point precision errors
- Example: `0.444` became `0.4440000000000001`
- **Fix Applied**: All percentages rounded to 3 decimal places

### 5. **Data Quality Issues in Source File**
- **10 SKUs** in Style_BOM don't sum to 100%:
  - 8 SKUs are significantly incomplete (totaling only 1.2% to 55.2%)
  - These appear to be data entry errors in the source file
  - Examples:
    - `FF25002/0008A`: Only 1.2% total
    - `CF5492/0`: Only 27.3% total
    - `205FLX2006/M`: Only 55.2% total
- **Action Required**: Manual review and correction of these SKUs

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Integration Logic Error**: The original integration process:
   - Dropped materials (possibly those below a threshold)
   - Renormalized remaining materials to sum to 100%
   - This created incorrect BOMs that don't reflect actual material composition

2. **No Validation**: The integration process didn't validate that:
   - All materials are preserved
   - Percentages remain unchanged
   - Totals sum to 100%

## Corrective Actions Taken

1. **Created Corrected BOM File**: 
   - File: `data/corrected_bom.csv`
   - Preserves all materials and original percentages
   - Includes validation flags for incomplete BOMs

2. **Updated Integration Process**:
   - Never drop materials regardless of percentage
   - Never renormalize percentages
   - Add validation checks to ensure data integrity
   - Round to 3 decimal places consistently
   - Log any SKUs that don't sum to 100% for manual review

3. **Documentation**:
   - This report documents all issues for future reference
   - Integration guide updated with best practices

## Validation Results

After correction:
- ✅ All 121 SKUs preserved (100%)
- ✅ All 330 BOM lines included
- ✅ Original percentages maintained
- ✅ Floating point precision standardized
- ⚠️ 10 SKUs still need manual correction for incomplete data

## Next Steps

1. **Use Corrected BOM**: Always use `data/corrected_bom.csv` for planning
2. **Fix Incomplete SKUs**: Review and complete the 10 SKUs with partial data
3. **Monitor Integration**: Validate future BOM updates before integration
4. **Update Source Data**: Correct the source Style_BOM.csv file
